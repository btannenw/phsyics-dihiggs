WSMaker: the HSG5 package for statistical analysis {#mainpage}
==================================================

Introduction
------------

This package performs the statistical analysis for the VHbb analysis.

It has two quite independent parts:
 * It creates workspaces from input files (ROOT files filled with histograms)
 * It performs fits, computes limits/p0, makes postfit plots, and performs all
 kinds of profile likelihood and fit checks.


Creation of workspaces
----------------------

VH workspaces use MC-based PDF everywhere, and so are based on the HistFactory tool.
However, given the complexity of the analysis, a heavy treatment is performed on
the inputs prior to the call to `hist2workspace`

### Requirements
The basic role of WSMaker is to take input files, write corresponding XML files,
and call `hist2workspace`. One might then wonder why it needs such a complicated
code (~8000 SLOC of C++) to perform a simple task.

It actually addresses a list of complex requirements:
 * Easy configuration of the analysis regions that should enter the fit model
 * Even for a super complex fit model, in terms of regions involved, with
 different discriminant distributions used (BDT, Mjj, MV1c)
 * Easy creation of workspaces with other distributions in the same analysis
 regions, to make postfit plots of any distribution
 * Use of complex rebinning schemes, to optimize fit performance while keeping
 the total number of bins in the fit model as low as possible
 * Smoothing of energy scale and energy resolution systematics, to avoid
 unphysical shapes in the likelihood
 * Various flavours of pruning of systematics, to keep the fit model as lightweight
 as possible while keeping the full precision of the results
 * Configure as simply as possible the systematics in the fit model:
   + Restrict the application of systematics to some analysis regions or some
   samples
   + Add user-defined flat systematics on some samples, in some regions
   + Allow for (sometimes complex) decorrelations of systematics between regions
   or samples
   + Easy creation of alternate workspaces with other decorrelations, to investigate
   the fit.
 * Can look for Higgs peak as well as diboson VZ peak, or both at the same time
 (choice of parameter of interest)
 * Optimization of the fit model through the merging of samples that can be fit
 together, while keeping the model mathematically equivalent to the fully split
 mode.

### Concepts

Below are listed some key concepts around which the code is built. Understanding
these concepts gives an overview of the main classes in the code, and of their
relations.

#### Splitting of input files

#### Data structure
To easily perform the actions required on the input histograms, one needs an internal
representation of the fit model.

The code uses a "matrix" representation, where the rows
are the samples used in the analysis (class `Sample`), and the columns are the
analysis regions (class `Category`). The cells are then `SampleInCategory`, where
each one then holds one nominal histogram. A third dimension arises in each cell,
which is made of all the systematic variations attached to the nominal histogram.

Depending on the task that needs be performed, an access through rows (browsing
samples) or through columns (browsing categories) will be made.

The `SampleHandler` manages the rows, while `CategoryHandler` manages the columns.

#### Keywords
In order to merge similar samples, or perform decorrelations of systematics for
groups of samples, it is useful to be able to easily refer to a given group of
samples.

In `SampleHandler`, keywords can be attached to samples, for instance the keyword
`Zjets` is attached to Zl, Zcl, Zcc, Zbc and Zbb samples.

This mechanism fulfills the requirement mentioned above.

### Further documentation
The header files themselves are documented usign Doxygen syntax. All the details
can be found there, as well as lists of allowed configuration flags, and explanations
of the configuration syntax when it is complex.
