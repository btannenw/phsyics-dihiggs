# phsyics-dihiggs
Code used for analysis of Higgs boson pair production.

- abcdStudies/ contains code I wrote using a data-driven method to estimate poorly simulated processes which contribute to the background in searches for Higgs pair production

- statCode/ contains the statistical machinery used to set limits on Higgs pair production. Many elements of the code I inherited, but several key components, wrappers, and steering scripts were written by me.
